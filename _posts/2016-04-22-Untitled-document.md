**Github Blog 22.04.16**

Today we looked at the BBC Micro:bit website. We just played around with it and figured out what to do with it. It looked incredibly hard, but by the end I was coding it like I had been coding it forever!

**What went well?**

I think it was a brilliant and fun lesson, and I thought it was very enjoyable. We looked around the website and tried different possibilities and codes. I created a game on the Microbit.

**Even better if...**

The tutorials had more variety.

**What is a 'Micro:bit'?**

It is a tiny computer that takes the code from your computer and displays it on the LCD screen. You can play games, watch animations and write things on it.
